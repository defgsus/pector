simple python vector/matrix lib with focus on 3d geomety

Every once and then a programmer should learn a new language and reimplement old stuff using new paradigms. If just for the sake of fascination. 

This is an attempt to write the basic building blocks for audio-visual art, namely the functional wrappers for pythagorean manipulation of position and transformation, in a most pythonian way. 

Once the interface is settled, i hope it will be possible to compile the lib with Cython and replace the C function bodies with the usual super-efficient matrix math wizardry and to use inplace operations as much as possible.
